## Session Handoff — 2026-01-02

### Completed

- Created `pmacs-utils` project from scratch in `C:\drivaslab\pmacs-utils`
- Set up Docker-based VPN bypass using `wazum/openconnect-proxy` image
- Created cross-platform scripts (bash + PowerShell) for connect/disconnect/status
- Wrote comprehensive README with ASCII architecture diagram
- Added SSH config example with ProxyCommand through SOCKS5 proxy
- Created platform-specific docs for Windows and Mac
- Added `.gitattributes` for proper line ending handling
- Initialized git, made 2 commits

### In Progress / Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Create `drivaslab/pmacs-utils` repo and push
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:drivaslab/pmacs-utils.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. **Test on Mac**: Clone repo, run setup, verify it actually works
   - Install Docker Desktop if not present
   - Run `./ssh/setup.sh` to configure SSH
   - Create `.env` with credentials
   - Run `./scripts/connect.sh` and approve DUO
   - Test `ssh prometheus`

3. **Potential improvements after testing**:
   - Add keepalive/watchdog for long sessions (like the VM had)
   - Consider adding `scp`/`rsync` wrapper scripts
   - Test if HTTP proxy (8888) is useful for anything
   - Add troubleshooting for specific error messages

### Relevant Context for Next Session

- This replaces the Hyper-V VM approach on Windows (which still works but is heavier)
- PMACS uses GlobalProtect with DUO push for MFA
- The old Windows setup is documented in `~/.claude/projects/ssh/` if reference needed
- Main cluster host is `prometheus.pmacs.upenn.edu`
- User's PMACS username should match their pennkey
